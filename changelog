	* rswt.py : remove upper limit for valid track numbers. 
	The WavTrigger firmware version 1.21 raised the upper 
	value to 2048. A test is not really needed for this.

	* documentation : Explain why the firmware of the wavtrigger
	should be updated to version 1.21+
	
	* version : push version on PyPI, to make it compatible with
	firmware versions 1.21+

	* this : add a good old changelog to the project
